## Explanation

The system should learn from each marketplace outcome and feed that learning to the rest of the business.

## Evidence

Roadmap Stage 5 now has an integrated contract pack for funnel taxonomy, leads and marketing candidate schemas, digest metrics, and redaction/replay rules recorded under `reports/validation/TASK-007-*.md` and the TASK-007 validation report.

## Validation

Validated on 2026-06-20 when the contract pack, synthetic examples, digest metrics, replay/redaction rules, and IPS gate evidence were integrated without enabling downstream runtime writes.
