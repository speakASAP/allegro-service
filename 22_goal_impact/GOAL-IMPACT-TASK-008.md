## Explanation

A revenue engine has to be trustworthy in production; otherwise scale amplifies failures.

## Evidence

Roadmap Stage 6 now has an integrated operational control pack for rate-limit and queue metrics, OAuth risk visibility, media and MinIO contract gating, and deployment smoke and rollback evidence recorded under `reports/validation/TASK-008-*.md` and the TASK-008 validation report.

## Validation

Validated on 2026-06-20 when the operational control pack, synthetic evidence, blocker ledger, and task-scoped gate results were integrated without enabling runtime scaling, media storage, or production alert delivery.
