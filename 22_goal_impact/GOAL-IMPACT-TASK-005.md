## Explanation

AI should make operators faster and offers better, not become an unsafe mutation path.

## Evidence

Roadmap Stage 3 requires AI suggestions to remain draft-only until policy-confirmed. TASK-005 now defines the advisory contract, review-state lifecycle, and redaction profile needed before any runtime client is approved.

## Validation

Validated on 2026-06-20 when the advisory contract, synthetic fixtures, prompt/context package, and validation evidence were added without changing runtime code or marketplace mutation ownership.
