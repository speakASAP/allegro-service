## Explanation

The Allegro service already has Catalog sell-action contracts and a frontend codebase, but the live public domain currently returns backend 404 for `/`. This goal makes the service customer-visible by publishing a clear landing page and a dashboard workflow modeled after the Bazos client experience while preserving Allegro-specific policy, OAuth, account, rate-limit, and Catalog ownership constraints.

## Evidence

- Owner request on 2026-06-27 created the new goal after live verification showed `https://allegro.alfares.cz/` returned backend 404 while `https://catalog.alfares.cz` hosted the only usable Catalog UI.
- `bazos-service` provides a working reference for landing, Auth handoff, client workspace, and catalog-to-channel publishing.
- TASK-004 already established the Allegro Catalog sell-action prepare/confirm/status contract.

## Validation

Validation succeeds when the frontend is built, route smokes prove the public domain serves the landing/dashboard instead of backend 404, and the product publish workflow either works end-to-end with explicit confirmation or reports source-backed blockers without implying unsupported behavior.
