## Explanation

TASK-001 exists to make `allegro-service` compliant with the company Intent Preservation System. The work protects operational service intent by requiring future implementation tasks to carry upstream traceability, invariant impact, data classification, execution plans, and validation evidence.

## Evidence

- Vision goals: `../01_vision/VISION.md`
- Feature: `../10_features/FEAT-001-ips-governed-allegro-delivery.md`
- Execution plan: `../21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-001-apply-ips-baseline.md`
- Validation report: `../12_validation/VAL-TASK-001-ips-baseline.md`

## Validation

The impact is validated when the IPS gate scripts run against the repository and the resulting reports show traceability, invariants, sensitive-data handling, and validation evidence.
