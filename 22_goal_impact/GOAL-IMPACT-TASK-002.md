primary_goal: Increase Allegro channel earnings through reliable governed publishing
secondary_goals:
  - VG-001 multi-account marketplace operations
  - VG-002 safe offer and stock synchronization
  - VG-004 operational production service
impact_level: critical
impact_description: Creates the execution foundation that future revenue features use to publish more offers safely and resolve failures faster.
success_metric: Publish success rate increases and blocked publish resolution time decreases after implementation.

## Explanation

This task exists because higher revenue depends on safely increasing marketplace activity. Durable attempts make failed publishes visible, allow safe retries, and give operators enough context to fix product, stock, account, or Allegro policy blockers.

## Evidence

- Roadmap stage 1 in `08_roadmap/ROADMAP.md`.
- Integration event taxonomy in `16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md`.
- Bazos comparison identified guarded lifecycle as the strongest pattern to adapt.

## Validation

Impact is validated by implementation evidence showing lifecycle records, idempotency, policy snapshots, redacted failures, and operator-visible status queries.
