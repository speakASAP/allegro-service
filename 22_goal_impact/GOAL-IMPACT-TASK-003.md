## Explanation

The policy engine makes the system better than a manual marketplace tool by telling operators exactly what prevents or improves a sale before money is lost.

## Evidence

Roadmap Stage 1 and Bazos guarded lifecycle comparison.

## Validation

Validated when policy results are deterministic, actionable, and connected to lifecycle attempts.
