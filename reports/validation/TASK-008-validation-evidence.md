# TASK-008 Validation Evidence

## Summary

TASK-008 closed as a planning-only operational readiness task on 2026-06-20. The integrated evidence comes from four isolated handoff lanes plus one supplemental MinIO note and the repo gate results. No runtime deploy, manifest edit, media implementation, alert-delivery integration, or secret-bearing evidence was introduced.

## Evidence artifacts

- `reports/validation/TASK-008-A-rate-limit-queue-handoff.md`: governed publish queue, stock-consumer, event-polling, and legacy bypass control map with metric and alert candidates.
- `reports/validation/TASK-008-B-oauth-health-handoff.md`: source-backed OAuth lifecycle, risk map, alert candidates, and explicit logging and routing blockers.
- `reports/validation/TASK-008-C-minio-media-handoff.md`: media and MinIO contract boundary, ownership and auth gaps, retention/fallback requirements, unresolved storage mode, Allegro image-update behavior, and downstream observability ownership.
- `reports/validation/TASK-008-D-smoke-rollback-handoff.md`: deploy smoke checklist, rollback evidence requirements, and deterministic failure-path classification steps.

## Integrated operational outcome

- Current rate-limit invariant remains `1 request per second per account` until a newer approved policy exists.
- Canonical queue and backpressure surfaces are the governed publish lifecycle, stock RabbitMQ consumer, and event-polling cursors.
- OAuth visibility outcome is planning-ready, but end-to-end alertability remains blocked on approved routing and remediation ownership.
- Media dependency outcome is contract-gated only: no MinIO runtime dependency should be implemented until ownership, auth, schema, retention, and stable Allegro-facing URL rules are approved.
- Deployment-readiness outcome is planning-ready, but runtime closure still requires a task-scoped rollback command and deeper readiness evidence if future coding changes are introduced.

## Shared-file conflict resolution

- `TASK-008-C-minio-media-handoff.md` is the surviving TASK-008-C handoff in the repo and is treated as the authoritative media-contract evidence for this closure step.
- No merge was attempted into shared operational files such as `16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md`, deploy scripts, manifests, or gate definitions in this closure step.

## Remaining blocked runtime facts

- `[MISSING: approved per-account queue depth budget, queue-age SLO, and retry budget thresholds]`
- `[MISSING: approved destination and schema for OAuth operational metrics and alert routing]`
- `[MISSING: owner-approved remediation plan for preview-style token and secret logging in OAuth paths]`
- `[MISSING: approved MinIO ownership boundary, auth model, object schema, retention policy, and fallback contract]`
- `[MISSING: task-scoped rollback command or repo-local rollback playbook for allegro-service deployments]`
- `[MISSING: deeper readiness signal covering dependencies beyond shallow /health]`
- `[MISSING: TASK-006-approved stock, order-forward, payments, suppliers, and economics contracts]`

## Safety evidence

All examples and metric names remain synthetic. The artifacts explicitly exclude OAuth tokens, Authorization headers, client secrets, queue credentials, customer identifiers, payment details, raw order payloads, raw media, and raw production logs.
