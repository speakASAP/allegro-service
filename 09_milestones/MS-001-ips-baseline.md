## Goal

Apply the company Intent Preservation System to `allegro-service` without changing production runtime behavior.

## Scope

- Canonical IPS folder structure.
- Service-specific traceability docs.
- Governance and documentation contracts.
- Gate scripts and package scripts.
- Validation report for the baseline.

## Completion Criteria

- Required IPS documents exist.
- Pre-coding and deployment-readiness gates can be executed.
- Validation evidence is captured under `12_validation/` or `reports/validation/`.

## Validation

Run strict documentation audit, pre-coding gate, and deployment-readiness gate.
