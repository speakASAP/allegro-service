# Allegro Primary Sales Channel Implementation Plan

Status: implementation master plan
Date: 2026-06-29
Owner: Allegro integration owner
Repository: `/home/ssf/Documents/Github/allegro-service`
Mode: planning and documentation only

This plan turns the current Allegro research and scripts into a governed primary
sales-channel platform for the Alfares ecosystem. Allegro is treated as the
first and most important sales channel, but the design must stay channel-aware
and not Allegro-only. Aukro, Bazos, FlipFlop, and future channels should reuse
the same ownership, projection, command, audit, and validation patterns.

The plan is intentionally explicit about what can be imported, what can be
exported, what cannot be written yet, and which service owns each decision. It
must be used together with:

- `docs/orchestrator/ALLEGRO_IMPORT_EXPORT_MAPPING.md`
- `16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `12_validation/VALIDATION_PYRAMID.md`
- `docs/orchestrator/VALIDATION_DEBT.md`
- `11_tasks/*`, `21_execution_plans/*`, `13_context_packages/*`,
  `14_prompts/*`, and `12_validation/*` for task-specific IPS spines.

## 1. Intent Preservation Chain

### Vision

Allegro becomes the primary Alfares sales channel. The ecosystem can import
from Allegro, export to Allegro, reconcile with Allegro, and operate Allegro at
full commercial scale without losing source-of-truth boundaries.

### Goal Impact

The business impact is a reliable two-way channel bridge:

- Import Allegro orders, offers, product snapshots, stock snapshots, payments,
  billing, shipments, returns, claims, invoices, and issues.
- Export Catalog-backed products and Warehouse-backed stock to Allegro through
  guarded preview/apply flows.
- Forward only valid, fully mapped orders to orders-microservice.
- Preserve auditability, replayability, rollback, idempotency, and owner
  approval for every write.
- Keep the same channel framework usable for Aukro, Bazos, FlipFlop, and other
  future channels.

### System

`allegro-service` is the Allegro channel adapter and channel projection service.
It is not the canonical product, stock, order, payment, or identity service.

`allegro-service` owns:

- Allegro OAuth/account state.
- Allegro API clients and rate-limit behavior.
- Raw Allegro payload capture and redaction.
- Allegro channel projections.
- Allegro publish/update/stock command attempts.
- Sync cursors, sync runs, replay evidence, and command audit logs.
- API gateway/frontend channel surfaces for Allegro operations.

Other systems keep their ownership:

- Catalog owns canonical products, descriptions, media, pricing, marketplace
  profile fields, and channel-neutral product identity.
- Warehouse owns physical stock and stock reservations.
- orders-microservice owns central order lifecycle and fulfillment-facing order
  records.
- payments/finance services own payment creation, refund orchestration, payout
  and settlement business logic.
- imports service owns BizBox/current supplier import preview/apply workflows.
- Auth owns user identity and hosted login.

### Feature

Primary sales-channel data platform for Allegro import, export, reconciliation,
and controlled write-back.

### Task

Refactor the existing scripts and update ecosystem contracts so Allegro data
flows through shared ownership policies, durable projection models, guarded
scripts, and explicit validation gates.

### Execution Plan

This document defines the master execution plan. Every implementation lane must
create or update a normal IPS task spine before coding:

- `11_tasks/TASK-0XX-*.md`
- `22_goal_impact/GI-TASK-0XX-*.md`
- `13_context_packages/CP-TASK-0XX-*.md`
- `21_execution_plans/EP-TASK-0XX-*.md`
- `14_prompts/PROMPT-TASK-0XX-*.md`
- `12_validation/VAL-TASK-0XX-*.md`
- graph nodes where the repo already expects them.

### Coding Prompt

Coding prompts must be lane-specific and must include allowed files, forbidden
files, mutation boundaries, validation commands, handoff path, and the rule to
mark unavailable facts as `[MISSING: ...]` or `[UNKNOWN: ...]`.

### Code

The first code changes should be guardrail and framework changes, not new live
import/export writes. Any live apply path must follow preview-token binding,
idempotency, owner approval, and validation evidence.

### Validation

Planning validation is documentation and diff hygiene. Implementation validation
must include IPS gates, targeted unit/integration tests, dry-run output,
before/after counts, and explicit no-mutation evidence where applicable.

## 2. Current Baseline

### Existing documented evidence

The mapping document already captures the current Allegro import/export model:

- Allegro order projection has been applied locally for 117 orders and 125 line
  items, with 0 unmapped orders in the documented run.
- Existing order projection tables are `AllegroOrder` and
  `AllegroOrderLineItem`.
- Existing offer/product projections are `AllegroOffer`, `AllegroProduct`, and
  `AllegroPublishAttempt`.
- Existing mapping states that orders-microservice should receive only the
  central order subset, while billing, payment operations, shipments, returns,
  claims, invoices, issues, offer snapshots, and stock snapshots remain separate
  channel projections unless a specific owner consumes them.
- Existing mapping states that Warehouse owns physical stock and Allegro stock
  is a channel listing quantity snapshot or target, not physical stock truth.

### Existing safe or partly safe paths

Safe/read-only or guarded paths found during the planning pass:

- `services/allegro-service/src/scripts/audit-current-stock-source.ts`
  - declares read-only behavior.
  - emits `mutates: false`.
  - treats `/sale/product-offers/{offerId}.stock.available` as current Allegro
    stock evidence.
- `services/allegro-service/src/scripts/import-checkout-forms-local.ts`
  - imports local Allegro checkout projection only.
  - has dry-run mode.
  - requires `--apply --confirm-local-only` for local projection writes.
  - explicitly forbids central orders, Catalog, Warehouse, Allegro, and BizBox
    writes.
- `services/imports/src/import/import.controller.ts`
  - exposes BizBox preview and apply endpoints.
  - preview is read-only.
- `services/imports/src/import/import.service.ts`
  - preview returns `mutatesWarehouse: false`.

### Existing unsafe or under-governed paths

These paths must be refactored before they are considered part of a primary
channel operating model:

- `services/allegro-service/src/scripts/import-order-offer-products.ts`
  - default dry-run exists.
  - `--apply` writes Catalog products, media, pricing, marketplace profiles, and
    local `AllegroOffer` rows.
  - its stock quantity comes from Allegro product-offer stock, not Warehouse.
- `services/allegro-service/src/scripts/import-allegro-offers-to-catalog.ts`
  - lacks a dry-run-only default gate.
  - activates account/settings and invokes import paths.
- `services/allegro-service/src/allegro/orders/orders.service.ts`
  - `syncOrdersFromAllegro()` upserts local orders/line items.
  - it can forward to orders-microservice.
- `services/allegro-service/src/allegro/offers/offers.service.ts`
  - legacy direct stock update is DB-first and then async remote write.
  - publish/update paths can POST/PATCH Allegro and activate offers.
- `services/imports/src/import/import.service.ts`
  - BizBox apply can create/update Catalog and set Warehouse stock.
- `scripts/migrate-products-to-catalog.ts`
  - live mode writes Catalog and Warehouse stock.
  - planning-safe flags are `--dry-run`, `--export-only`, and `--skip-stock`.
- Destructive or high-risk scripts:
  - `scripts/clean-database.ts`
  - `scripts/clean-catalog-products.ts`
  - any bulk delete/deactivate helpers in offer services.

### Current architectural gaps

- No implemented generic sales-channel abstraction exists yet.
- The only explicit channel value found in runtime mapping is
  `channel: "allegro"` in order forwarding.
- Generic `SyncJob` is too weak for primary-channel operations because it lacks
  account/domain/cursor identity.
- `WebhookEvent` is not linked to durable sync runs or projection audit logs.
- Existing idempotency is concentrated around publish attempts, not all import,
  projection, stock, billing, return, shipment, and command flows.
- PII is present in `AllegroOrder.rawData`, buyer fields, delivery addresses,
  and payment/billing payloads. Logging and raw payload storage need redaction
  rules before broad sync expansion.

## 3. North Star Architecture

### Principle A: channel adapter, not source of truth

`allegro-service` stores channel projections and command attempts. It never
becomes the canonical product, stock, order, payment, or identity database.

### Principle B: raw payload plus normalized projection

Every imported domain needs both:

- Raw payload capture, hashed and redacted.
- Normalized projection tables for query, UI, replay, and owner handoff.

Raw payloads preserve evidence. Projections preserve operability.

### Principle C: preview before apply

Every write-capable path must support:

- read-only discovery;
- dry-run;
- preview artifact;
- preview token bound to input hash, actor, account, mode, and time window;
- explicit confirmation;
- idempotent apply;
- post-apply evidence.

### Principle D: commands before remote writes

Remote Allegro writes must be represented as command attempts before and after
the API call. A command attempt records request payload, response payload,
idempotency key, status polling, terminal state, and failure context.

### Principle E: source-backed stock only

Warehouse owns stock. Allegro stock is a channel target or snapshot. Ordered
quantity is historical demand. BizBox/current supplier quantity is evidence for
import decisions, not automatically current physical stock unless a Warehouse
owner-approved workflow converts it.

### Principle F: channel-agnostic core vocabulary

Allegro should set the reference implementation for:

- channel account;
- channel listing;
- channel listing snapshot;
- channel order projection;
- channel stock snapshot;
- channel stock command;
- channel payment/billing projection;
- channel shipment/return/invoice projection;
- channel sync run;
- channel raw payload;
- channel command audit.

Future channels should implement those concepts with channel-specific clients
and projection details.

## 4. Target Components

### 4.1 Allegro API Client Layer

Purpose:

- Provide typed wrappers by Allegro domain.
- Centralize OAuth/account resolution.
- Centralize rate-limit handling and retries.
- Prevent scripts from calling raw HTTP clients directly.

Required client domains:

- accounts and OAuth status;
- sale offers and product-offers;
- categories and parameters;
- checkout forms;
- billing and billing types;
- payment operations and refunds;
- customer returns and refund claims;
- invoices;
- sale issues;
- shipping rates and shipments;
- One Fulfillment read surfaces where applicable;
- offer quantity change commands;
- publish/update/activation operations.

Acceptance criteria:

- Every client method declares direction: read, write, command-status, or
  mutation.
- Every mutation method accepts an idempotency key or command id where Allegro
  supports it.
- Every method returns sanitized metadata for logs.
- No new script bypasses this layer.

### 4.2 Sync Run Layer

Purpose:

- Track every import/export/audit run.

### 4.6 Command Attempt Layer

Purpose:

- Represent every outbound Allegro write before it happens.
- Support idempotency, retries, status polling, and failure review.

Existing model:

- `AllegroPublishAttempt`

Additional proposed models:

- `AllegroStockCommandAttempt`
- later generic `AllegroCommandAttempt` if publish, stock, shipment, invoice, and
  issue flows need a shared command table.

## 5. Data Ownership Matrix

| Domain | Allegro source | Local projection | Canonical owner | Export-back owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Account/OAuth | Allegro auth | `AllegroAccount` | allegro-service | allegro-service | Hosted Auth remains human identity owner. |
| Product identity | Allegro product/offers, Catalog | `AllegroProduct`, `AllegroOffer.catalogProductId` | Catalog | Catalog plus Allegro publisher | Allegro stores channel links, not canonical product truth. |
| Offer/listing | Allegro sale offer/product-offer | `AllegroOffer` | allegro-service for channel snapshot; Catalog for product content | Allegro publish lifecycle | Listing is a channel representation of Catalog data. |
| Category/parameters | Allegro category APIs | category/parameter cache or raw payload | allegro-service cache, Catalog mapping policy | Allegro publisher | Needed before valid export-back. |
| Stock snapshot | Allegro product-offer detail | `AllegroOfferStockSnapshot` | Warehouse for physical stock; allegro-service for channel snapshot | Warehouse-backed stock command lane | Ordered quantity is not stock. |
| Stock command | Allegro quantity command API | `AllegroStockCommandAttempt` | Warehouse decision, allegro-service command | Warehouse-backed stock sync planner | Blocked until stock orchestration approval. |
| Checkout/order | Allegro checkout forms | `AllegroOrder`, `AllegroOrderLineItem` | orders-microservice for central order | orders-microservice | Forward only fully mapped orders. |
| Buyer/delivery | Allegro checkout forms | order projection fields/raw payload | orders-microservice after accepted forward | none | PII, redaction required. |
| Payment summary | Allegro checkout/payment summary | order projection plus payment operation projection | payments/finance for payment logic | none initially | Start read-only. |
| Billing entries | Allegro billing APIs | `AllegroBillingEntry` | finance/accounting consumer | none initially | Do not mix with order records. |
| Payment operations | Allegro payment operation APIs | `AllegroPaymentOperation` | finance/payments | none initially | No captures/refunds/payout writes initially. |

## 6. Import Domains

### 6.1 Orders

Goal:

- Import Allegro checkout forms into local projections.
- Forward only valid and mapped order payloads to orders-microservice.

Current state:

- Local projection importer exists and is guarded.
- Runtime order service can upsert projections and forward to orders.

Required changes:

- Split `OrderProjectionImporter` from `OrderForwardingService`.
- Add sync-run and raw-payload capture to local order imports.
- Add account-aware cursors.
- Add replay equality checks for forwarded payloads.
- Add blocked state for orders with unmapped line items or missing Catalog links.
- Add a no-forward mode for all bulk import scripts.

Forwarding criteria:

- Every line item has a Catalog product mapping.
- `externalOrderId` is stable and unique per channel account.
- `channel = "allegro"`.
- `channelAccountId` is included.
- Buyer/delivery/payment summary fields are redacted in logs.
- Replay of the same source payload produces the same central order payload.

Do not do yet:

  a separate owner-approved contract.

### 6.2 Offers and Products

Goal:

  - price mismatch;
  - stock must not be trusted from Allegro.
- Add account-aware offer identity.

Do not do yet:

- Do not use Allegro product-offer stock as Warehouse stock.
- Do not activate accounts/settings as a side effect of an import script.

### 6.3 Stock Snapshots

Goal:

- Import current Allegro listing stock as channel evidence.

- Persist snapshot source endpoint, fetched time, payload hash, and authority
  classification.
- Add dry-run compare between current `AllegroOffer.stockAvailable` and fresh
  product-offer detail stock.
- Emit warnings when order history, offer list, product-offer detail, and local
  projection disagree.

Do not do yet:

- Do not mutate Warehouse.
- Do not mutate Allegro stock.
- Do not infer stock from order quantity.

### 6.4 Billing and Payment Operations

- No legacy DB-first Allegro stock update in production.
- No stock import based on historical order quantity.

### 7.3 Orders Back to Allegro

Goal:

- Only after central order and fulfillment owner approval, decide which statuses
  or shipment events should be written back to Allegro.

Current plan:

- Read-only order import and central forwarding first.
- Shipment/fulfillment write-back is a later lane.

Forbidden now:

- No order status write-back.
- No shipment creation.
- No refund/claim/invoice write-back.

## 8. Existing Script Refactor Plan

### 8.1 `import-checkout-forms-local.ts`

Target state:

- Thin CLI wrapper around `OrderProjectionImporter`.
- Uses `AllegroSyncRun`, `AllegroRawPayload`, `AllegroProjectionAuditLog`, and
  `AllegroSyncCursor`.
- Keeps default dry-run and `--apply --confirm-local-only`.
- Adds optional `--preview-token` once preview artifacts are implemented.

Allowed writes:

- Local Allegro order projections only, and only in confirmed local-only mode.

Forbidden writes:

- orders-microservice.
- Catalog.
- Warehouse.
- Allegro.
- BizBox/imports.

Code comment anchor:

- At the apply gate: "This script writes local Allegro projections only. Do not
  add central order forwarding here; use the owner-gated forwarding lane."

### 8.2 `import-order-offer-products.ts`

Target state:

- Split into:
  - offer/product raw import;
  - local channel projection update;
  - Catalog proposal generation;
  - Catalog apply through owner-gated preview token.
- Default dry-run remains.
- `--apply` cannot write Catalog unless a preview token confirms Catalog owner
  scope.

Allowed writes after refactor:

- Local Allegro offer/product projections in confirmed local projection mode.
- Catalog writes only through `CatalogChannelProjectionService` with owner gate.

Forbidden writes:

- Warehouse stock writes.
- Allegro remote writes.
- automatic account activation.

Code comment anchor:

- Near marketplace quantity mapping: "Marketplace quantity is a channel override
  or listing snapshot; it is not Warehouse physical stock."

### 8.3 `import-allegro-offers-to-catalog.ts`

Target state:

- Refactor or deprecate.
- It must become dry-run by default.
- Account activation/settings changes must be removed from import side effects.
- Catalog writes must route through preview-token apply.

Allowed writes after refactor:

- None by default.
- Catalog writes only with explicit owner-confirmed apply.

Forbidden writes:

- Account activation as import side effect.
- Warehouse writes.
- Allegro writes.

### 8.4 `audit-current-stock-source.ts`

Target state:

- Keep read-only.
- Add optional persistence of `AllegroOfferStockSnapshot` in local-only confirmed
  mode, after schema exists.
- Keep `mutates: false` for audit mode.

Allowed writes:

- None in audit mode.
- Future local snapshot projection only with explicit local-only confirmation.

Forbidden writes:

- Warehouse.
- Allegro.
- Catalog.
- orders-microservice.

### 8.5 `scripts/harvest-order-offers.js`

Target state:

- Deprecate or rewrite in TypeScript under the shared script framework.
- Must not bypass guards.

### 8.6 `scripts/migrate-products-to-catalog.ts`

Target state:

- Keep out of normal Allegro channel operations.
- If retained, wrap live mode with owner-gated preview/apply and `--skip-stock`
  default.
- Document as migration-only, not operational sync.

Code comment anchor:

- Near `setStock`: "Warehouse stock mutation is owner-gated. Do not run from an
  Allegro channel sync without the Warehouse-approved import contract."

### 8.7 BizBox import scripts/services

Target state:

- Keep preview/apply split.
- Require category mapping readiness.
- Bind apply to preview token and input hash.
- Route Warehouse stock mutation through Warehouse-approved policy only.

Code comment anchor:

- Near BizBox apply stock path: "BizBox stock changes mutate Warehouse and are
  not part of Allegro channel import unless the imports and Warehouse owners
  approve the apply run."

### 8.8 Offer publish/update/stock service methods

Target state:

- `AllegroListingPublisher` owns create/PATCH/activate.
- `WarehouseBackedStockSyncPlanner` owns stock command planning.
- Legacy public endpoints call governed services or are blocked for production.

Code comment anchors:

- Near direct stock update method: "Legacy DB-first stock update is not approved
  for production stock sync. Use durable stock command attempts."
- Near PATCH quantity payload: "This is Allegro channel target quantity, not a
  physical stock source."

Forbidden files/actions: live import/export/stock mutations unless explicitly
approved.
Expected output: updated master plan, task spine, merge decisions, validation
summary.
Dependencies: all lanes.
Validation owner: integration owner plus dedicated validation lane.
Handoff path: `reports/validation/TASK-0XX-integration-owner-handoff.md`

### W1: Script framework refactor

Status: ready_parallel after task spine creation
Owner role: scripts/CLI agent
Objective: Build shared script guard framework and convert safe scripts first.

- destructive scripts.

Expected output:

- guard framework;
- standard JSON summaries;
- code comments at apply gates;
- dry-run validation evidence.

Dependencies:

- W0 task spine.

Validation:

- `git diff --check`
- `cd services/allegro-service && npm run build`
- dry-run output with `mutates: false`.

Merge order:

- after W0 docs and before converting unsafe scripts.

### W2: Schema and projection foundation

Owner role: data model agent
Objective: Add additive sync, cursor, raw payload, audit, and stock snapshot
models.
Allowed files:

- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `prisma/migrations/*`
- schema docs.

Merge order:

- before pipelines depend on new tables.

### W3: Orders integration

Status: dependency_gated by W2 and orders owner contract
Owner role: orders integration agent
Objective: Split local projection from central order forwarding and make replay
safe.
Allowed files:

- order projection/forwarding services;
- order mapper tests;
- order validation docs.

Forbidden files/actions:

- bulk central order apply;
- central order status/payment writes.

Expected output:

- replay equality tests;
- mapping completeness report;
- blocked-order report;
- owner-approved apply runbook.

Dependencies:

- W2 schema;

Owner role: Catalog/Allegro publish agent
Objective: Centralize offer publish/update/activate and make Catalog export
auditable.
Allowed files:

- publish lifecycle service;
- Catalog sell action service;

Implemented foundation:

- Publish lifecycle `prepare` returns a deterministic preview token bound to the
  redacted command payload, target, idempotency key, requester, and stale window.
- Publish lifecycle `confirm` requires the preview token and stores only token
  hash/confirmation metadata in `policySnapshot.previewTokenBinding`.
- Catalog sell-action confirm routes pass the preview token through to the
  governed publish lifecycle.

Remaining gated work:

- direct update/publish convenience routes need explicit preview-token request
  body propagation or must remain fail-closed;
- category/parameter completeness evidence is still required before broad offer
  export apply;
- live publish/update execution remains prohibited without owner approval and
  preview-token confirmation.

Validation:

## 12. Parallel Execution Model

### Ready now

These lanes can start after a task spine is created:

- W1 script framework refactor.
- W2 sync/projection schema foundation.
- W6 billing/payment projection design.
- W7 logistics/after-sale projection design.
- W8 frontend/API route and screen contract.
- W9 validation and operations runbooks.
- W10 channel-agnostic adapter blueprint.

### Dependency-gated

These lanes must wait:

- W3 orders integration waits for W2 plus orders owner contract.
- W4 offer export waits for category/parameter validation and W2.
- W5 stock sync waits for Warehouse semantics and stock orchestration approval.
- BizBox apply hardening waits for import owner and Warehouse/Catalog owner
  gates.

### Blocked

These are blocked until explicit approval:

- live Allegro stock apply;
- Warehouse mutation from Allegro/import flows;
- BizBox apply to Catalog/Warehouse;
- central order replay apply at scale;
- refunds/captures/payouts/settlement writes;
- return/claim/invoice/issue/shipment write-back;
- production publish/activate without governed lifecycle.

### Shared files and conflict control

Only the integration owner should edit shared contracts in parallel:

- `TASKS.md`
- `STATE.json`
- `16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md`
- `graph/project_graph.example.yaml`
- shared validation reports
- shared Prisma schema if multiple lanes add models at once.

Workers should either:

- edit disjoint implementation files; or
- write isolated handoffs under `reports/validation/TASK-0XX-*-handoff.md`.

### Merge order

1. Master plan and task spine.
2. Validation/operations runbook.
3. Additive schema foundation.
4. Script framework.
5. Read-only clients/projections.
6. UI read surfaces.
7. Owner-approved central order forwarding.
8. Owner-approved publish lifecycle writes.
9. Owner-approved Warehouse-backed stock commands.
10. Owner-approved after-sale/logistics/finance write-back.

## 13. Validation Gates

### Planning gate

Commands:

- `git status --short --branch`
- `git diff --check`
- `npm run ips:audit`

Evidence:

- clean or intentional diff;
- no live mutation;
- no Chrome/browser-control;
- no deploy.

### Pre-coding gate

Commands:

- `npm run ips:pre-coding`

Notes:

- This command writes `reports/validation/ips-pre-coding-gate.json`.
- Run it only when task spine exists and report output is intended.

### Build gates

Commands:

- `cd services/allegro-service && npm run build`
- `cd services/frontend && npm run build`
- `cd services/api-gateway && npm run build`

Run only for lanes touching those services.

### Prisma gates

Commands:

- Prisma generate command used by the repo.
- migration SQL review.
- targeted repository/service tests.

Evidence:

- additive schema changes;
- no destructive migration;
- compatibility with existing camelCase fields.

### Dry-run gates

Every import/export-capable script must provide:

- command run;
- JSON summary;
- `mutates` flags;
- count summary;
- input hash;
- warning/blocker list.

### Apply gates

Apply requires:

- owner-approved task;
- preview artifact;
- preview token;
- input hash match;
- actor/account/scope match;
- idempotency key;
- before/after counts;
- rollback or remediation plan.

## 14. Security and Privacy

Sensitive data:

- buyer names;
- buyer emails;
- buyer logins;
- phone numbers;
- delivery addresses;
- invoice details;
- payment and refund details;
- issue/claim/return messages;
- raw payloads.

Rules:

- Do not log full raw payloads.
- Use payload hashes in summaries.
- Redact buyer and address fields in validation artifacts.
- Limit raw payload access to trusted debug paths.
- Record `piiClass` and `redactionVersion`.
- Avoid storing binary invoice/shipment documents until storage policy exists.
- Do not expose tokens, OAuth secrets, or account credentials in docs or logs.

## 15. Rollout Strategy

### Stage 1: read-only visibility

- Build sync runs and projections.
- Import data locally.
- Show dashboards.
- No external writes.

### Stage 2: local-only projection applies

- Allow local projection writes with confirmation.
- Validate replay and audit logs.
- No sibling service or Allegro writes.

### Stage 3: owner-approved internal writes

- Forward mapped orders to orders-microservice.
- Apply Catalog projections only through Catalog owner-approved paths.
- Keep Warehouse writes blocked unless explicitly approved.

### Stage 4: owner-approved Allegro writes

- Publish/update listings through governed lifecycle.
- Apply stock quantity commands after Warehouse approval.
- Keep finance/logistics/after-sale write-back blocked until owners approve.

### Stage 5: operational automation

- Schedule imports.
- Process webhooks.
- Trigger stock command planning from Warehouse events.
- Alert on drift, failed commands, stale cursors, and unmapped orders.

## 16. Open Questions

Use `[MISSING: ...]` or `[UNKNOWN: ...]` in implementation docs until these are
resolved:

- `[MISSING: confirmed Allegro OAuth scopes for billing, payments, returns, claims, invoices, issues, shipments, and fulfillment]`
- `[MISSING: Warehouse sellable stock semantics and reservation policy]`
- `[MISSING: stock orchestration approval for live Allegro quantity commands]`
- `[MISSING: category and parameter mapping completeness for publish]`
- `[MISSING: finance owner decision for payment/refund/settlement writes]`
- `[MISSING: customer service owner decision for return/claim/issue write-back]`
- `[MISSING: fulfillment owner decision for shipment label/document creation]`
- `[MISSING: production account rate-limit policy]`
- `[MISSING: raw payload retention policy]`
- `[MISSING: central order duplicate/idempotency behavior confirmation]`
- `[UNKNOWN: whether One Fulfillment is enabled for the current account]`
- `[UNKNOWN: whether all 60 visible Sales Center orders are represented in the current local projection snapshot]`

## 17. Future Code Comment Checklist

Add short comments only where they prevent unsafe edits:

- `services/allegro-service/src/allegro/orders/orders.service.ts`
  - near forwarding: central order writes are orders-owner gated.
- `services/allegro-service/src/allegro/offers/offers.service.ts`
  - near legacy stock update: DB-first stock update is not production-approved.
  - near PATCH quantity: Allegro quantity is channel target, not stock source.
- `services/imports/src/import/import.service.ts`
  - near BizBox apply stock path: Warehouse mutation is owner-gated.
- `scripts/migrate-products-to-catalog.ts`
  - near `setStock`: migration stock mutation is not normal Allegro sync.
- `services/allegro-service/src/scripts/import-order-offer-products.ts`
  - near Catalog marketplace quantity: channel quantity is not physical stock.
- `services/allegro-service/src/scripts/import-checkout-forms-local.ts`
  - near apply gate: local projection only, no central forwarding.

## 18. Agent Prompt Template

Use this prompt shape for future Codex subagents or separate threads:

```text
Goal: <one specific lane objective>

Repository: ssh alfares, /home/ssf/Documents/Github/allegro-service

Mode:
- Follow AGENTS.md and IPS.
- Do not use Chrome/browser-control.
- Do not run live import/export/stock mutations.
- Do not mutate Warehouse, BizBox, Allegro, orders, payments, or Catalog unless
  this prompt explicitly allows it.

Intent chain:
Vision -> Goal Impact -> System -> Feature -> Task -> Execution Plan -> Coding
Prompt -> Code -> Validation

Allowed files:
- <explicit file list>

Forbidden files/actions:
- <explicit list>

Expected output:
- <artifact, tests, handoff path>

Validation:
- git status --short --branch
- git diff --check
- <targeted build/test/dry-run>

Handoff:
- Summarize changed files.
- Summarize validation evidence.
- Mark missing facts as [MISSING: ...] or [UNKNOWN: ...].
- Do not invent contracts.
```

## 19. Immediate Next Implementation Sequence

The safest next sequence is:

1. Create `TASK-010` IPS spine for Allegro primary channel foundation.
2. Run validation/operations lane to define exact gate commands and report
   format.
3. Implement script framework and convert the already safe local order importer.
4. Add additive sync-run/cursor/raw-payload/audit schema.
5. Convert read-only stock audit to optionally emit local stock snapshots.
6. Add billing/payment and logistics/after-sale projection schemas and read-only
   clients.
7. Harden order forwarding with replay equality.
8. Harden Catalog publish lifecycle.
9. Only after Warehouse approval, implement stock command attempts and live
   quantity command apply.

This order gives the ecosystem useful Allegro visibility before it allows new
external writes.
