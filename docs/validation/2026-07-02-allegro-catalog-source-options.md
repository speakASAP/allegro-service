# Allegro Catalog Source Options Validation

Date: 2026-07-02
Role: worker agent
Remote repo: `/home/ssf/Documents/Github/allegro`

## Intent Preservation Chain

- Vision: shared Catalog-backed product sourcing in every e-commerce dashboard.
- Goal Impact: Allegro sellers can select own, Alfares/company, and community resale Catalog products without losing current-user publish ownership.
- System: Catalog owns product source/resale truth; Allegro owns marketplace draft and guarded publish flow.
- Feature: dashboard source filters, Catalog management entry points, and sell-action Catalog access checks.
- Task: implement missing personal-cabinet Catalog source/resale options in Allegro.
- Execution Plan: use the saved cross-repo plan and touch only the allowed Allegro frontend/API/sell-action client files.
- Coding Prompt: preserve dirty worktree files, do not deploy, and mark unavailable contracts as `[MISSING: ...]` or `[UNKNOWN: ...]`.
- Code: see worker diff for `ProductsPage.tsx` and frontend `api.ts`; the existing `/api/products/*` gateway proxy forwards the human `Authorization` and `X-User-Id` headers to Catalog.
- Validation: see final worker report for command results.

## Requirement Matrix

| Requirement | Allegro result after this worker |
|---|---|
| R1 Alfares/company Catalog products | Source checkbox and quick filter for `alfares`; frontend sends `catalogSources=alfares` while retaining `catalogScope=effective`. |
| R2 Upload/manage own products | External Catalog Dashboard links added for manage products and add product: `https://catalog.alfares.cz/dashboard/products`, `https://catalog.alfares.cz/dashboard/products/new`. |
| R3 Publish own products for common resale | Allegro now exposes a local community resale toggle for selected Catalog products and sends `PUT /api/products/:id` with `resaleEnabled` through the authenticated Catalog proxy. |
| R4 Load/select own, community, company products | Source checkboxes cover `own`, `alfares`, and `community`, and API fallback keeps the effective product load if `catalogSources` is rejected. |
| R5 Non-owned products read-only in Catalog | Known Alfares/other-seller products are read-only in the UI; unknown ownership and server-side enforcement surface Catalog owner-guard errors, including 403 responses, in the selected product panel. `[UNKNOWN: Catalog runtime owner-only enforcement not smoke-tested in this worker]` |
| R6 Channel publication remains user-owned | Existing Allegro draft/publish controls remain bound to the authenticated user's Allegro account choices. |

## Remaining Blockers

- `[UNKNOWN: Catalog runtime owner-only enforcement not smoke-tested in this worker]` - no authenticated browser/API token was available to prove a live owner update and non-owner 403 from the running Catalog service.
- `[MISSING: catalog sell-action human-scope enforcement]` - sell-action now forwards the human bearer token and `catalogScope=effective` into Catalog product reloads, but final enforcement depends on Catalog honoring that token alongside the internal service token.
- `[UNKNOWN: authorized end-to-end runtime token]` - no authenticated browser/API smoke token was available in this worker session.
