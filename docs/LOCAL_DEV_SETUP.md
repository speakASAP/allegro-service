# Local Development Setup with Production Services

This guide explains how to set up local development environment that uses production database and services via SSH.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Timeout and Delay Issues

**IMPORTANT**: Issues within our services are **NOT** timeouts - increasing timeouts does **NOT** help!

- We have up to **30 items** to request or get, so speed within Docker network on the same server is **perfect**
- All delays are because of **bad code**, **NOT** timing issues
- If you see timeout delays, **DON'T increase timeouts** - **check logs** to see what process hangs!

**What to do when you see timeouts:**
1. Check the logs immediately - look for what process is hanging
2. Look for infinite loops, blocking operations, or unhandled promises
3. Check database queries - are they taking too long?
4. Check external API calls - are they hanging?
5. **DO NOT** increase timeout values - fix the underlying code issue instead!

**Remember**: We're on the same Docker network with max 30 items. Network speed is not the problem - code is.

## Overview

For local development, you'll:

- Run services locally (via `npm run start:dev` or Docker)
- Connect to production database via SSH tunnel
- Use production microservices (auth, logging, notifications) via HTTPS

## Prerequisites

1. SSH access to production server (`ssh statex` must work)
2. Node.js 20+ installed
3. Docker Desktop (optional, for containerized development)

## Step 1: Configure .env File

Your `.env` file should have the following database configuration:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost          # ✅ Correct for SSH tunnel
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=dbadmin
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=allegro
DATABASE_URL=
```

**Important Notes:**

- `DB_HOST=localhost` is **correct** - the SSH tunnel forwards localhost:5432 to production
- `DATABASE_URL` should **NOT** include `?schema=public` query parameter (Prisma will add it automatically if needed)
- Password in `DATABASE_URL` must be URL-encoded (already done above)

### Environment-Specific Differences

The codebase uses the same code for both development and production environments. Only the `.env` file values differ. The following table shows the key variables that differ between environments:

| Variable | DEV Value | PROD Value | Reason |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production` | Environment identifier |
| `AUTH_SERVICE_URL` | `https://auth.statex.cz` | `http://auth-microservice-green:3370` | DEV uses HTTPS, PROD uses Docker network |
| `DB_HOST` | `localhost` | `db-server-postgres` | DEV uses SSH tunnel, PROD uses Docker network |
| `ALLEGRO_REDIRECT_URI` | `http://localhost:3410/auth/callback` | `https://allegro.statex.cz/auth/callback` | DEV uses localhost, PROD uses production domain |
| `LOGGING_SERVICE_URL` | `http://localhost:3367` | `http://logging-microservice:3367` | DEV uses SSH tunnel, PROD uses Docker network |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | `http://localhost:3410` | `https://allegro.statex.cz` | DEV uses localhost, PROD uses production domain |

**Key Points:**

- All other variables (ports, API keys, etc.) should be the same or appropriately configured for each environment
- DEV environment uses `localhost` with SSH tunnels to connect to production services
- PROD environment uses Docker service names for internal communication
- The codebase contains **no hardcoded values** - everything comes from `.env` files

## Step 2: External Services Configuration

For local development, you have two options:

### Option A: Use SSH Tunnels (Recommended)

Set up SSH tunnels for all services to use production services directly:

```bash
# Start all tunnels (database, auth, logging, notifications)
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start
```

Then configure your `.env` file:

```bash
# External Shared Microservices (via SSH tunnels)
# Note: AUTH_SERVICE_PORT is required for gateway to use localhost in development
AUTH_SERVICE_PORT=3371
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=https://auth.statex.cz  # Fallback if tunnel not available
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3368
LOGGING_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3367
```

### Option B: Use HTTPS URLs

Use production HTTPS URLs directly (requires services to be healthy on production):

```bash
# External Shared Microservices
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=https://auth.statex.cz
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=https://notifications.statex.cz
LOGGING_SERVICE_URL=https://logging.statex.cz
```

**Note**: If you see 502 errors, the services may be down on production. Use Option A (SSH tunnels) instead.

## Step 3: Start SSH Tunnels

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before starting your local services, you **must** start the SSH tunnels to production services. Without these tunnels, you will see connection errors like "Failed to send log to logging service" and services may fail to start.

```bash
# Start all tunnels (database, auth, logging, notifications)
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start

# Check tunnel status
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh status

# Test all connections
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh test
```

The tunnels will:

- **Database**: Forward `localhost:5432` → `statex:127.0.0.1:5432` (Required for database access)
- **Auth Service**: Forward `localhost:3371` → `statex:127.0.0.1:3371` (Required for authentication)
- **Logging Service**: Forward `localhost:3367` → `statex:127.0.0.1:3367` (Required - prevents "Failed to send log to logging service" errors)
- **Notifications Service**: Forward `localhost:3368` → `statex:127.0.0.1:3368` (Optional, for notifications)
- Run in the background
- Store PIDs in `/tmp/allegro-tunnels/`

**Note**: Make sure your `.env` file has `LOGGING_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3367` to match the tunnel configuration.

**Port Consistency:**

- Both development and production now use **port 3367** for consistency
- In production, Docker services use `http://logging-microservice:3367` (internal Docker network)
- In development, SSH tunnels use `http://localhost:3367` (host port mapping)
- The same port (3367) is used in both environments, only the hostname differs

### SSH Tunnel Commands

```bash
# Start all tunnels
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start

# Start specific tunnel
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start db
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start auth
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start logging
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start notifications

# Stop all tunnels
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh stop

# Stop specific tunnel
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh stop auth

# Restart all tunnels
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh restart

# Check status of all tunnels
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh status

# Test all connections
./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh test
```

## Step 4: Verify Database Connection

Test the database connection using Prisma:

```bash
# Test with Prisma
npx prisma db execute --stdin <<< "SELECT 1 as test;"
```

Expected output: `Script executed successfully.`

## Step 5: Start Local Services

### Option A: Development Mode (Recommended for Local Dev)

1. **Build shared module first:**

   ```bash
   cd shared
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Start SSH tunnel** (if not already running):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start
   ```

3. **Start all services:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

   This will start:
   - API Gateway (port 3411)
   - Allegro Service (port 3403)
   - Import Service (port 3406)
   - Settings Service (port 3408)
   - Frontend Service (port 3410)

### Option B: Docker Compose

1. **Start SSH tunnel:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start
   ```

2. **Start services:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## OAuth Configuration

To use OAuth for accessing user-specific Allegro resources (like `/sale/offers`), you need to configure the redirect URI:

1. **Set `ALLEGRO_REDIRECT_URI` in `.env`**:

   ```bash
   ALLEGRO_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3410/auth/callback
   ```

2. **Configure in Allegro Developer Portal**:
   - Go to [Allegro Developer Portal](https://developer.allegro.pl/)
   - Add the redirect URI to your application settings
   - The URI must match exactly (including protocol and port)

3. **Authorize the Application**:
   - Go to Settings page in the application
   - Configure your Allegro Client ID and Client Secret
   - Click "Authorize with Allegro" button
   - You'll be redirected to Allegro to grant permissions
   - After authorization, you'll be redirected back to the application

**Note**: OAuth is required for accessing user-specific resources. The `client_credentials` grant type only works for public endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Fails

1. **Check SSH tunnel is running:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh status
   ```

2. **Verify tunnel is listening:**

   ```bash
   lsof -i :5432
   # Should show SSH process listening on port 5432
   ```

3. **Test SSH connection:**

   ```bash
   ssh statex "echo 'SSH connection works'"
   ```

4. **Check database credentials in .env:**
   - Verify `DB_HOST=localhost` (not `db-server-postgres`)
   - Verify `DB_PASSWORD` is correct
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` has URL-encoded password

### SSH Tunnel Not Starting

1. **Check if port 5432 is already in use:**

   ```bash
   lsof -i :5432
   ```

2. **Kill existing tunnel:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh stop
   ```

3. **Check for stale processes:**

   ```bash
   ps aux | grep "ssh.*5432"
   ```

### Services Can't Connect to External Services

1. **Verify HTTPS access:**

   ```bash
   curl -I https://auth.statex.cz/health
   curl -I https://logging.statex.cz/health
   curl -I https://notifications.statex.cz/health
   ```

2. **Check network connectivity:**
   - Ensure you have internet access
   - Check if firewall is blocking HTTPS connections

## Important Notes

1. **Always start SSH tunnel before services** - Services will fail to start if database is not accessible

2. **Stop tunnel when done** - To free up the port:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh stop
   ```

3. **Database changes affect production** - Be careful! You're working with production database

4. **Service URLs** - External services (auth, logging, notifications) use HTTPS and don't require SSH tunnel

## DEV Troubleshooting

### "Failed to send log to logging service" Error

If you see this error in your service logs, it means the logging service tunnel is not running or the `.env` configuration is incorrect.

**Solution:**

1. **Check if logging tunnel is running:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh status
   ```

2. **Start the logging tunnel if not running:**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start logging
   ```

3. **Verify `.env` has correct port:**

   ```bash
   cat .env | grep LOGGING_SERVICE_URL
   ```

   Should show: `LOGGING_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3367`

4. **Restart your services** to pick up the `.env` changes:

   ```bash
   # Stop services (Ctrl+C or kill processes)
   # Then restart:
   npm run start:dev
   ```

5. **Test logging service connection:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3367/health
   ```

   Should return: `{"success":true,"status":"ok",...}`

### Other Common Issues

- **503 Service Unavailable**: Check if required services are running (allegro-service, settings-service, etc.)
- **Database connection errors**: Verify SSH tunnel is running: `./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh status`
- **Auth service errors**: Ensure auth tunnel is running: `./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start auth`

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] SSH access to `statex` works (`ssh statex`)
- [ ] `.env` file configured with:
  - `DB_HOST=localhost`
  - `LOGGING_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3367` (important!)
  - `AUTH_SERVICE_PORT=3371`
- [ ] SSH tunnels started (`./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh start`)
  - Verify all tunnels are running: `./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh status`
  - At minimum: database, auth, and logging tunnels must be running
- [ ] Database connection tested (`npx prisma db execute --stdin <<< "SELECT 1;"`)
- [ ] Logging service accessible: `curl http://localhost:3367/health`
- [ ] Shared module built (`cd shared && npm run build`)
- [ ] Services started (`npm run start:dev` or `docker compose up -d`)

## Summary

✅ **Database**: Access via SSH tunnel (`localhost:5432` → `statex:127.0.0.1:5432`) - **Required**  
✅ **Auth Service**: Access via SSH tunnel (`localhost:3371` → `statex:127.0.0.1:3371`) - **Required**  
✅ **Logging Service**: Access via SSH tunnel (`localhost:3367` → `statex:127.0.0.1:3367`) - **Required** (prevents "Failed to send log" errors)  
✅ **Notifications Service**: Access via SSH tunnel (`localhost:3368` → `statex:127.0.0.1:3368`) - Optional  

**Important Notes:**

- **All tunnels must be started before running services** to avoid connection errors
- Make sure `.env` has `LOGGING_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3367`
- If you see "Failed to send log to logging service" errors, check that the logging tunnel is running: `./scripts/setup-ssh-tunnel.sh status`
- **Alternative**: You can use HTTPS URLs (`https://auth.statex.cz`, etc.) if services are healthy on production, but SSH tunnels are recommended for reliability

All services run locally but connect to production infrastructure via SSH tunnels.
