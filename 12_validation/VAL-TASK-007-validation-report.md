## Summary

Validated TASK-007 as a contract-first documentation task by integrating four remote handoff artifacts for funnel taxonomy, leads and marketing schemas, digest metrics, and redaction/replay/versioning guidance. The repo now carries the Stage 5 growth contract pack and validation evidence without enabling runtime writes to leads-microservice, marketing-microservice, logging-microservice, or notifications-microservice.

## Upstream goal

TASK-007 supports FEAT-007 and roadmap Stage 5 by defining versioned growth signals that can later explain which products should be listed, promoted, replenished, improved, or suppressed while preserving catalog, warehouse, orders, and sensitive-data boundaries.

## Criteria checked

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Funnel event taxonomy is versioned | Pass | `reports/validation/TASK-007-A-funnel-taxonomy-handoff.md` defines a canonical envelope and a draft `2026-06-20.allegro-funnel.v1` taxonomy candidate aligned to existing `allegro.*` names. |
| Leads and marketing events have explicit schemas | Pass | `reports/validation/TASK-007-B-leads-marketing-handoff.md` defines draft `leads-demand-signal` and `marketing-growth-segment` envelopes with ownership, consent, and replay boundaries explicit. |
| Digest metrics are defined from available data | Pass | `reports/validation/TASK-007-C-digest-metrics-handoff.md` defines daily and weekly digest payload drafts, deterministic window rules, metric calculations, and snapshot guardrails. |
| Redaction rules are testable | Pass | `reports/validation/TASK-007-D-redaction-replay-handoff.md` defines omitted-field requirements, replay/idempotency rules, versioning policy, and safety validation cases. |
| External runtime gaps are explicit | Pass | The four handoff files and `reports/validation/TASK-007-validation-evidence.md` record concrete downstream owner, telemetry, payment/refund, cancellation, and margin-data gaps without inventing missing contracts. |

## Gate evidence

- `npm run ips:audit`: PASS on 2026-06-20.
- `npm run ips:pre-coding`: PASS on 2026-06-20.
- `python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-007`: PASS on 2026-06-20.

## Invariant evidence

- ALG-INV-001: TASK-007 defines product and offer growth signals without bypassing catalog validation or approving direct offer mutation.
- ALG-INV-002: Contract candidates preserve channel/account context and replay-safe identities; no Allegro API rate-limit behavior changed.
- ALG-INV-003: Order-derived signals remain read-only and redacted; TASK-007 does not introduce local order ownership.
- ALG-INV-004: All handoffs and evidence remain synthetic and explicitly exclude secrets, OAuth material, customer identifiers, payment details, raw order payloads, and production logs.
- ALG-INV-005: No runtime ownership boundary changed. TASK-007 defines contract candidates only and leaves downstream runtime writes blocked on explicit external owners and APIs.
- ALG-INV-006: TASK-007 is linked through vision, system, feature, task, execution plan, integrations map, handoff evidence, validation report, TASKS.md, and STATE.json before closure.
- ALG-INV-007: Validation evidence is recorded before status closure.

## Sensitive-data scan evidence

The contract pack uses synthetic identifiers such as `ACCOUNT_SYNTHETIC_001`, `PRODUCT_SYNTHETIC_001`, `OFFER_SYNTHETIC_001`, synthetic UUID-like placeholders, and `example.invalid` references only. No real buyer email, buyer login, address, OAuth token, client secret, payment detail, or raw production event payload was added.

## Replay and determinism evidence

- Growth envelopes require `contractVersion`, `sourceService`, `channel`, `occurredAt` or `observedAt`, `correlationId` where applicable, and deterministic `idempotencyKey` fields.
- Windowed digest outputs use inclusive-start and exclusive-end UTC windows and label snapshot metrics as render-time only.
- Duplicate delivery behavior is defined as safe no-op or explicit last-write-wins keyed by `idempotencyKey`; actual downstream runtime adoption remains blocked until consumer owners approve their duplicate semantics.

## Issues found

- Downstream runtime APIs and owners for leads, marketing, and digest delivery are still absent from the checked-in source of truth.
- Click telemetry, cancellation sourcing, payment-settled/refund sourcing, and TASK-006 economics inputs are not available in the current checked-in runtime paths.
- TASK-007 intentionally stops at contract-first closure. Future runtime implementation still needs separate approved tasks once downstream contracts and source facts exist.

## Recommendation

Close TASK-007 as implemented and validated at the contract level. Continue with TASK-008 execution-plan review while keeping TASK-006 blocked on external stock/order/payment/supplier/economics contracts.

## Traceability confirmation

TASK-007 remains aligned with VISION, SYS-001, FEAT-007, GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-007, EP-TASK-007, `16_operations/INTEGRATIONS.md`, the four TASK-007 handoff artifacts, `reports/validation/TASK-007-validation-evidence.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `STATE.json`. The implementation preserves the Intent Preservation chain and introduces no downstream runtime side effects.
