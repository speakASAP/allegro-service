Date: 2026-06-20
Validator: AI agent

## Summary

Validated TASK-005 by approving and documenting an advisory-only ai-microservice contract, synthetic fixtures, review-state lifecycle, and redaction profile for Allegro offer optimization without introducing runtime DTOs, Prisma schema, workers, or direct marketplace mutation.

## Upstream goal

TASK-005 supports FEAT-005 and the roadmap goal to improve listing readiness and conversion through governed AI recommendations while preserving lifecycle confirmation, catalog ownership, and rollback visibility.

## Criteria checked

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Contract distinguishes suggestions from approved offer changes | Pass | `16_operations/AI_OFFER_OPTIMIZATION_CONTRACT.md` defines advisory-only request/response payloads, `summary.overallStatus = ADVISORY_ONLY`, and review states that require manual approval before lifecycle mapping. |
| Redaction and data-minimization rules are documented | Pass | The contract and fixture report exclude OAuth tokens, customer identifiers, raw order/payment data, supplier secrets, and production logs; only aggregated metrics remain. |
| Suggestions flow into lifecycle only after explicit approval | Pass | The approved review-state lifecycle requires `APPROVED_FOR_APPLY` before any future mapping into TASK-002/TASK-004 lifecycle flows, and TASK-005 explicitly forbids direct apply endpoints. |
| Validation uses synthetic examples | Pass | `reports/validation/TASK-005-validation-evidence.md` contains synthetic request, response, and local-record fixtures using synthetic UUIDs and `example.invalid` asset URLs only. |

## Gate evidence

- `npm run ips:audit`: PASS on 2026-06-20.
- `npm run ips:pre-coding`: PASS on 2026-06-20.
- `python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-005`: PASS on 2026-06-20.

## Invariant evidence

- ALG-INV-001: the contract keeps catalog-owned product facts separate from channel-state suggestions and requires catalog-approved mapping before lifecycle-confirmed mutation.
- ALG-INV-002: request payloads carry account context and keep future apply paths subject to account-aware rate limits rather than bypassing them.
- ALG-INV-003: no order ownership behavior changed; only aggregated performance signals are allowed.
- ALG-INV-004: the fixtures and contract remain synthetic and redacted; no OAuth token, Authorization header, secret, customer identifier, payment detail, supplier secret, or raw log was introduced.
- ALG-INV-005: no runtime ownership boundary changed; TASK-005 is documentation-only and explicitly marks missing ai-microservice auth/runtime facts instead of inventing them.
- ALG-INV-006: TASK-005 is linked through feature, goal impact, execution plan, context package, coding prompt, contract document, validation report, and graph updates.
- ALG-INV-007: validation evidence is recorded before closure.

## Sensitive-data scan evidence

The request fixture uses synthetic offer/catalog/account identifiers, aggregate view/conversion counts, and `example.invalid` image URLs. The response fixture uses synthetic rationale strings instead of copied marketplace text. The local record example stores only redacted policy snapshot data and model metadata placeholders.

## Replay and determinism evidence

The contract requires `contractVersion`, `correlationId`, and `snapshotHash` on both request and response so future apply flows can detect stale or mismatched AI output. Review states remain deterministic because `APPROVED_FOR_APPLY`, `REJECTED`, `EXPIRED`, `APPLIED`, and `ROLLED_BACK` are explicit transitions controlled outside the model response.

## Issues found

- Future runtime implementation still lacks an approved internal auth handshake for ai-microservice calls, a provider metadata contract for model/version reporting, and owner-approved experiment-window defaults. Those gaps are documented in the approved contract artifact and intentionally left for a later runtime task.
- TASK-005 intentionally stops at contract-first closure. A separate approved runtime task is still required before any ai-microservice client, queue worker, DTO, Prisma schema, or apply endpoint can be introduced.

## Recommendation

Close TASK-005 as implemented and validated. Continue with TASK-006 execution-plan review and keep any future implementation split into owner-bounded subtasks when external contracts remain missing.

## Traceability confirmation

TASK-005 remains aligned with FEAT-005, EP-TASK-005, GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-005, CP-TASK-005, PROMPT-TASK-005, the approved AI contract document, and the Allegro revenue roadmap. The implementation preserves the IPS chain and introduces no runtime side effects.
