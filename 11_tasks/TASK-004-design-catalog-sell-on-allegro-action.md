## Objective

Design the catalog-facing Sell on Allegro API that prepares a draft, evaluates policy, requires confirmation, queues publish, and returns status.

## Goal Impact

This task increases revenue by reducing friction between catalog products and Allegro listings while preserving product ownership and publish guardrails.

## Project Invariant Impact

Applies ALG-INV-001 through ALG-INV-007.

## Sensitive-Data Classification

Classification: synthetic. Use synthetic catalog products, accounts, offers, and status payloads.

## Contract/Schema Impact

Creates a cross-service contract consumed by catalog-microservice; requires DTO and endpoint validation.

## Replay/Determinism Impact

Prepare and confirm must be idempotent.

## Scope

Prepare, confirm, status, bulk planning, account/category choice, readiness blockers, and gateway/auth behavior.

## Non-Goals

No direct catalog posting to Allegro. No AI generation in this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Prepare creates or reuses draft only.
- [x] Confirm queues only policy-allowed attempts.
- [x] Status returns blockers and next action.
- [x] Bulk operations respect rate limits.

## Required Context

FEAT-002, FEAT-003, Bazos catalog sell-action reference, catalog client, gateway controller.

## Validation Task

Contract tests, controller tests, lifecycle integration tests, gateway smoke.

## Required Gates

Contract review, pre-coding gate, targeted tests, deployment-readiness gate.

## Execution Plan Requirement

This task was approved for implementation by owner instruction on 2026-06-19 and is now implemented and validated.
