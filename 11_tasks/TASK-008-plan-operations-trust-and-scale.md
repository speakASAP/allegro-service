## Objective

Plan operational controls for rate limits, OAuth health, queues, media, dashboards, deployment evidence, and rollback.

## Goal Impact

This task protects revenue by making continuous Allegro operations stable, observable, and recoverable.

## Project Invariant Impact

Applies ALG-INV-002, ALG-INV-004, ALG-INV-005, ALG-INV-006, and ALG-INV-007.

## Sensitive-Data Classification

Classification: synthetic. Operational reports must not include raw tokens, secrets, or unmasked customer or order details.

## Contract/Schema Impact

Creates planning-level monitoring DTO candidates, operational evidence requirements, and a MinIO media contract gate without enabling runtime media storage.

## Replay/Determinism Impact

Queue controls and deployment checks must be deterministic enough for repeated validation.

## Scope

Rate-limit backpressure, OAuth expiry monitoring, MinIO and media contract discovery, SLA dashboards, production smoke, rollback playbooks.

## Non-Goals

No boundary changes without ADR. No media storage implementation until MinIO contract is approved. No runtime deployment, manifest edits, or alert-routing integration in this task closure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rate-limit and queue controls are measurable.
- [x] OAuth risks are alertable at the planning level.
- [x] Deployment smoke checklist is documented.
- [x] MinIO and media dependency is contract-gated.

## Required Context

Roadmap Stage 6, deployment scripts, Kubernetes manifests, OAuth services, lifecycle monitoring.

## Validation Task

Operational readiness report, smoke checklist, and failure-path tests for later coding tasks.

## Required Gates

Deployment-readiness gate, operational gate, sensitive-data scan.

## Execution Plan Requirement

This task is now implemented and validated as a planning-only operations control pack. Future coding prompts for runtime scaling, alert routing, or media storage still require separate approved tasks and source-backed external contracts.
