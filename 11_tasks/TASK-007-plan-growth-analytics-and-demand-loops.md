## Objective

Define growth event, leads, marketing, and digest contracts that turn Allegro operations into demand intelligence.

## Goal Impact

This task helps the system earn more by identifying which products should be listed, improved, replenished, discounted, promoted, or removed.

## Project Invariant Impact

Applies ALG-INV-004, ALG-INV-006, and ALG-INV-007.

## Sensitive-Data Classification

Classification: synthetic. No raw customer identifiers, raw order records, or production logs in analytics examples.

## Contract/Schema Impact

Creates event contracts for logging, leads, marketing, and notifications.

## Replay/Determinism Impact

Growth events must be replay-safe and idempotent where consumed by leads or marketing systems.

## Scope

Funnel taxonomy, demand signals, segment definitions, digest payloads, redaction policy, and event versioning.

## Non-Goals

No production writes to leads/marketing until contracts are validated. No customer PII exports.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Funnel event taxonomy is versioned.
- [ ] Leads and marketing events have explicit schemas.
- [ ] Digest metrics are defined from available data.
- [ ] Redaction rules are testable.

## Required Context

Roadmap Stage 5, integrations document, logging service, notification service, sensitive data policy.

## Validation Task

Synthetic event contract tests and redaction scan.

## Required Gates

Pre-coding gate, contract validation, replay/idempotency review.

## Execution Plan Requirement

This task must not be converted into a coding prompt until an approved execution plan exists.
