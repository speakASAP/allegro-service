## Objective

Define and implement Allegro policy gates that evaluate whether an offer mutation is allowed, risky, or blocked before it reaches Allegro.

## Goal Impact

Policy gates increase earnings by helping more products become publish-ready while preventing failed listings, oversell, duplicate offers, missing compliance data, weak content, and margin-negative sales.

## Project Invariant Impact

Applies ALG-INV-001, ALG-INV-002, ALG-INV-004, ALG-INV-006, and ALG-INV-007.

## Sensitive-Data Classification

Classification: synthetic. Policy fixtures must use synthetic identifiers and redacted errors.

## Contract/Schema Impact

Likely creates policy DTOs and may persist policy snapshots. Cross-service contracts are read-only unless separately approved.

## Replay/Determinism Impact

Policy output must be deterministic for the same input snapshot.

## Scope

Catalog, OAuth/account, rate-limit, duplicate, category, attribute, media, stock, price/margin, delivery, payment, GPSR, and responsible-producer gates.

## Non-Goals

No AI generation, no direct publish, no payment/supplier writes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Policy result distinguishes blockers, warnings, and recommendations.
- [ ] Every blocker has owner service and remediation guidance.
- [ ] Policy output is reusable by lifecycle, catalog action, AI suggestions, and monitoring.
- [ ] Tests cover synthetic passing and blocked products.

## Required Context

Roadmap, integrations, project invariants, catalog/warehouse/order clients, Allegro API service, Prisma schema.

## Validation Task

Policy unit tests, redaction scan, and integration-readiness review.

## Required Gates

Pre-coding gate, contract review, targeted tests, deployment-readiness gate.

## Execution Plan Requirement

This task must not be converted into a coding prompt until an approved execution plan exists.
