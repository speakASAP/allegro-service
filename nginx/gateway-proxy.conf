# Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration for API Gateway
# Handles connection pooling to backend services to eliminate TCP connection delays
# Uses upstream blocks with keepalive for connection pooling AND dynamic DNS resolution

# Docker's internal DNS resolver (127.0.0.11 is Docker's embedded DNS server)
# valid=10s means DNS results are cached for 10 seconds, then re-resolved
# This ensures that when services restart and get new IPs, nginx will pick them up within 10s
resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=10s ipv6=off;

# Upstream blocks with keepalive for connection pooling
# This enables connection reuse while still supporting dynamic DNS resolution
# keepalive: Number of idle keepalive connections to maintain per worker
# resolve: Enables runtime DNS resolution (re-resolved every 10s via resolver directive)
# zone: Required for shared memory when using resolve directive
