## Excluded documents

- Real secret files, Vault-managed values, environment files, token values,
  production exports, raw customer records, raw order payloads, raw payment
  payloads, and unmasked screenshots.
- Sibling service implementation files unless a later approved lane explicitly
  owns a public contract check.
- Runtime apply output from Warehouse, BizBox, Allegro, Orders, Payments, or
  Catalog mutation endpoints.

## Constraints

These constraints are active for every TASK-010 worker and are not optional
guidance.

- Work in the remote repository only.
- Do not use Chrome/browser-control.
- Do not run live import and export/stock mutations.
- Do not run the current-stock Warehouse import apply path.
- Do not mutate Warehouse stock or BizBox/current supplier data.
- Do not forward central orders at scale.
- Do not perform Allegro publish, update, activation, stock command, refund,
  invoice, issue, return, claim, fulfillment, or shipment write-back.
- Keep unavailable facts explicit and do not invent missing contracts,
  approvals, source evidence, or validation results.
- Treat pre-existing TASK-009 documentation audit failures as validation debt
  unless TASK-010 changes introduce or touch the failing artifact.

## Agent prompt

Implement the smallest TASK-010 slice allowed by the execution plan. Preserve
Vision -> Goal Impact -> System -> Feature -> Task -> Execution Plan -> Coding
Prompt -> Code -> Validation. Start with guarded script framework and additive
projection groundwork only. Do not execute live mutation paths. Return files
changed, validation evidence, deviations, and blockers.

## Validation instructions

- Run `git status --short --branch` before and after.
- Run `git diff --check` before commit.
- Run `npm run ips:audit` and classify pre-existing TASK-009 audit debt
  separately from TASK-010 findings.
- For code changes under `services/allegro-service`, run
  `cd services/allegro-service && npm run build`.
- Do not claim deploy readiness until
  `python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-010`
  passes or its blocker is documented.
