## Excluded documents

- Runtime implementation files outside future approved follow-up tasks
- Real secret files, Vault-managed values, `.env` material, and production exports
- Raw customer, payment, supplier, or production log payloads

## Constraints

- TASK-007 is closed as a contract-first documentation task only.
- No runtime leads, marketing, digest-delivery, clickstream, payment/refund, cancellation, or margin-warning implementation is approved in this package.
- Future runtime work must preserve catalog, warehouse, orders, rate-limit, and sensitive-data invariants.
- Synthetic examples only; no OAuth tokens, customer identifiers, payment details, raw order payloads, or production logs.

## Agent prompt

If a later approved runtime task is opened, implement only the smallest bounded growth-event or digest slice that reuses the validated TASK-007 contract pack and does not invent downstream APIs, owners, consent rules, or economics inputs.

## Validation instructions

- Re-read `VAL-TASK-007-validation-report.md` before changing any TASK-007 artifact.
- Keep downstream runtime gaps explicit as documented in `reports/validation/TASK-007-validation-evidence.md`.
- Re-run `npm run ips:audit`, `npm run ips:pre-coding`, and `python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-007` if TASK-007 documentation changes again.
