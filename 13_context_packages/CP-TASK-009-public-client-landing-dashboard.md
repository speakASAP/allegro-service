## Excluded documents

- External Bazos reference files that live outside this repository
- Real secret files, Vault-managed values, `.env` material, OAuth tokens, JWTs, and Authorization headers
- Raw customer, payment, order, supplier, or production log payloads
- Runtime product, offer, order, stock, Warehouse, Catalog, or Allegro write operations outside the approved TASK-009 UI/runtime serving scope

## Constraints

- TASK-009 is live validated and closed as the public landing and registered-client dashboard implementation.
- The dashboard may expose existing guarded publish lifecycle controls, but it must not imply or implement autonomous publishing.
- Catalog validation, account readiness, OAuth readiness, backend rate-limit ownership, and explicit confirmation remain backend/lifecycle boundaries.
- Public route and protected API evidence must stay route/status oriented and synthetic.
- External Bazos artifacts are reference material only and must not be represented as local IPS paths.

## Agent prompt

If TASK-009 documentation is changed again, preserve the existing live-validated implementation record and keep all updates inside the FEAT-009 to TASK-009 to EP-TASK-009 to PROMPT-TASK-009 to code to VAL-TASK-009 chain. Do not introduce new runtime behavior from this preserved prompt; open a new bounded task for follow-up product behavior, Auth, Catalog, publish lifecycle, deployment, or smoke-test changes.

## Validation instructions

- Re-read `VAL-TASK-009-public-client-landing-dashboard.md` before changing TASK-009 status or evidence.
- Re-run `npm run ips:audit`, `npm run ips:pre-coding`, and `python3 scripts/deployment_readiness_gate.py --root . --target TASK-009` after TASK-009 documentation changes.
- For runtime changes, also run the affected frontend/backend build or targeted spec named by the new task.
